To develop a prototype of a video conversion process that can convert SD resolution (640 x 480px) videos to HD resolution (1280 x 720px) videos using a diffusion type model.Here ESRGAN is used for video image super resolution.The tool should be able to fill in the blank areas on the left and right sides of the video with relevant pixels or image parts while preserving the context of the video.

Objective: To develop a prototype of a video conversion process that can convert SD videos to HD videos using diffusion (image to image, Inpainting) type models, while preserving the context of the video and being efficient.

Requirements: The video conversion tool should be able to: ● Convert SD videos to HD videos using diffusion type models. ● Preserve the context of the video. ● Fill in the blank areas on the left and right sides of the video with relevant pixels or image parts. ● Be efficient so that it can convert videos in a reasonable amount of time.
